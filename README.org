* Heading faces for ~outline-minor-mode~

Unlike ~outline-mode~, ~outline-minor-mode~ does not change
the appearance of headings to look different from comments.

This package defines the faces ~outline-minor-N~, which inherit
from the respective ~outline-N~ faces used in ~outline-mode~
and arranges for them to be used in ~outline-minor-mode~.

*** Usage

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package outline-minor-faces
    :after outline
    :config (add-hook 'outline-minor-mode-hook
		      #'outline-minor-faces-mode))
#+end_src

If you want to only enable these faces in certain major-modes, then
add ~outline-minor-faces-mode~ to their hooks instead of to the above
hook, but make sure ~outline-minor-mode~ is enabled first.
